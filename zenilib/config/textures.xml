<!-- Images to load into the Textures Database in Zenilib
     Sprites to build in the Textures Database in Zenilib

For each Texture entry in Textures:

  1. 'token' should match the name you want to use in C++
  2. 'is_sprite' should 0 (or absent [deprecated])
  3. 'filepath' should be the path from within 'zenilib/'
  4. 'tile' should be 0 for best quality if tiling is unnecessary
     'tile' should be 1 to enable tiling
     
     If 'tile' is 1 and tiling is not desired, floating point
     error can make things look worse at the edges of tiles.

For each Sprite entry in Textures:

  1. 'token' should match the name you want to use in C++
  2. 'is_sprite' should be 1
  3. 'frame's should be the tokens of existing Textures
     
     All 'frame's must have been defined earlier in the file.
     'frame's defined later in the file will be ignored.

The following formats are supported:

  1. PNG is supported with 8 bits per channel.
  2. BMP is fully supported AFAIK.
  3. TIFF is supported with 8 bits per channel.
     TIFF supports deflate and JPEG compression.

The following things are unsupported:

  1. JPEG and GIF images
  2. Indexed color
  3. Indexed transparency
  4. Anything other than 8 bits per channel
