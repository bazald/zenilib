To prevent code from using (A),

  1. Right-click on project Zeniapp in the Solution Explorer.
  2. Left-click on Properties in the menu that pops up.
  3. Navigate to 'Configuration Properties'/'C/C++'/'Preprocessor'
  4. Append a semicolon followed by (B) to the Preprocessor Definitions
       Alternatively, right click on the "..." at the end of the Preprocessor Definitions field and add a new line containing (B).
  5. Navigate to 'Configuration Properties'/'Linker'/'Input'
  6. Remove entries (C) from Additional Dependencies.  This can be done in two ways, just like step 4.
